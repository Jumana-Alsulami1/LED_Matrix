2- Connect the LED Matrix to the Arduino

The Arduino circuit :

1- VCC of the LED matrix with the Arduino's 5V.

2- GND of the LED matrix with Arduino's GND.

3- DIN of the LED matrix with Arduino's Pin 12.

4- CS of the LED matrix with Arduino's Pin 11.

5- CLK of the LED matrix with Arduino's Pin 10.

3- Write the Arduino Code.
